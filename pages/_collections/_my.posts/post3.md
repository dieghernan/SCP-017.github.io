## Introduction
Proton VPN is currently at the top of The Best Free VPN charts right now. Partly that's for its nicely-judged mix of features, power and app quality. But it's also because the service doesn't pile on the limits and restrictions to try and persuade you to upgrade. This is a free VPN you could use long-term.

There are still significant limits. You only get access to three locations, for instance: USA, Netherlands and Japan. Although you can install Proton VPN on as many devices as you like, you can only connect one at a time. There's no access to Proton VPN's specialist streaming servers, no P2P support, or bonus extras such as ad and malware-blocking – to use them, you'll have to upgrade to a premium plan(opens in new tab).

But for most users, Proton VPN Free delivers just about everywhere: it's fast, secure, and has powerful features, yet it's also effortless to use. If you need a free VPN, try this one first.

## Unique Features

#### Secure Core
Regular VPN services can be compromised if their servers are under surveillance. Proton VPN prevents this by first passing user traffic through our Secure Core network in privacy-friendly countries like Switzerland and Iceland. Thus, even a compromised VPN endpoint server will not reveal your true IP address.

#### Perfect Forward Secrecy
Proton VPN exclusively uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy, meaning that your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future.

#### Adblocker (NetShield)
NetShield is a DNS filtering feature that protects you from malware, blocks ads, and prevents website trackers from following you as you surf the web.

#### Swiss Based
We are headquartered in Switzerland which has some of the world's strongest privacy laws. Switzerland is also outside of EU and US jurisdiction and is not a member of the fourteen eyes surveillance network.

#### No-logs Policy
Proton VPN is a no logs VPN service. We do not track or record your internet activity, and therefore, we are unable to disclose this information to third parties.

#### Tor Over VPN
Proton VPN also integrates with the Tor anonymity network. With a single click, you can route all your traffic through the Tor network and access Onion sites.

## Final Words

### Why use Proton VPN?

#### Security
Our secure VPN sends your internet traffic through an encrypted VPN tunnel, so your passwords and confidential data stay safe, even over public or untrusted Internet connections.

#### Privacy

#### Freedom
We created Proton VPN to protect the journalists and activists who use Proton Mail. Proton VPN breaks down the barriers of Internet censorship, allowing you to access any website or content.
